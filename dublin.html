          <h4 class="heading-subheading-sub mb-sm">
            A vibrant and exciting community
          </h4>

          <p class="text mb-sm">
            Dublin bills itself as “The New American Backyard.” From a modest
            population of about 14,350 in 1982, Dublin has grown to a city of
            over 63,000 residents. One of the fastest-growing cities in Alameda
            County, Dublin is projected to have a total population of 75,000 at
            its fully developed peak.
          </p>
          <p class="text mb-sm">
            A very forward-thinking town, Dublin offers many different types of
            housing. Special projects include affordable housing apartments
            designed in particular for military members and veterans. Townhomes
            have been build close to transit and shopping. Downtown Dublin even
            has free wi-fi.
          </p>
          <p class="text mb-sm">
            City leaders have focused on diversity. The city's location at the
            crossroads of Highways 580 and 680 and its two BART stations have
            attracted many large corporations, particularly high tech.
          </p>
          <p class="text mb-sm">
            There are lots and lots of shops and restaurants here and the many
            offered cuisines make dining an internationally-flavored experience.
            Sports fields and a new swim center complete with two pools and
            waterslides add to the many community amenities.
