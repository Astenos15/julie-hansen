            A small town feeling with big city amenities
          </h4>

          <p class="text mb-sm">
            Located about 25 miles east of Oakland, Pleasanton is an Alameda
            County suburb with a population of more than 82,000. The U.S. Census
            Bureau has ranked Pleasanton as the wealthiest middle-sized city in
            the United States. Pleasanton’s location at the crossroads of
            Highways 680, 580 and 84 make it convenient to transportation. It
            also has two BART stations.
          </p>
          <p class="text mb-sm">
            Pleasanton is home to the company headquarters of Workday, Ellie
            Mae, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Blackhawk Network Holdings, and
            Veeva Systems. Other major employers include Kaiser Permanente,
            Safeway, Oracle, Nordstrom and Macy's. The Alameda County
            Fairgrounds are located in Pleasanton, where the county fair is held
            during the last week of June and the first week of July. Pleasanton
            Ridge Regional Park is located on the west side of town.
          </p>
          <p class="text mb-sm">
            Pleasanton was ranked number 4 in USA Today's list of "America's 50
            Best Cities to Live In" in 2014, number 63 in Money Magazine's list
            of "The Best Places to Live" in 2010, and was named one of
            "Americans' Top Hometown Spots" in the United States in 2009 by
            Forbes. Pleasanton was named the third wealthiest city in terms of
            earnings in the United States by NerdWallet in 2013.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            In 1917, Pleasanton became the backdrop for the film Rebecca of
            Sunnybrook Farm, starring Mary Pickford. The town was once home to
            Phoebe Apperson Hearst, who lived in a 50-room mansion on a
            2,000-acres estate that is now the site of Castlewood Country Club.
            The lively downtown has an Americana, small-town feel with historic
            buildings filled with great shops and restaurants offering al fresco
            dining. The Saturday morning farmers' market is one of the best in
            the East Bay.
