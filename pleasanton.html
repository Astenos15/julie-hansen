          A small town feeling with big city amenities
        </p>

        <p class="communities-page__text mb-sm">
          Located about 25 miles east of Oakland, Pleasanton is an Alameda
          County suburb with a population of more than 82,000. The U.S. Census
          Bureau has ranked Pleasanton as the wealthiest middle-sized city in
          the United States. Pleasanton’s location at the crossroads of Highways
          680, 580 and 84 make it convenient to transportation. It also has two
          BART stations.
        </p>
        <p class="communities-page__text mb-sm">
          Pleasanton is home to the company headquarters of Workday, Ellie Mae,
          Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Blackhawk Network Holdings, and Veeva
          Systems. Other major employers include Kaiser Permanente, Safeway,
          Oracle, Nordstrom and Macy's. The Alameda County Fairgrounds are
          located in Pleasanton, where the county fair is held during the last
          week of June and the first week of July. Pleasanton Ridge Regional
          Park is located on the west side of town.
        </p>
        <p class="communities-page__text mb-sm">
          Pleasanton was ranked number 4 in USA Today's list of "America's 50
          Best Cities to Live In" in 2014, number 63 in Money Magazine's list of
          "The Best Places to Live" in 2010, and was named one of "Americans'
          Top Hometown Spots" in the United States in 2009 by Forbes. Pleasanton
          was named the third wealthiest city in terms of earnings in the United
          States by NerdWallet in 2013.
        </p>
        <p class="communities-page__text mb-sm">
          In 1917, Pleasanton became the backdrop for the film Rebecca of
          Sunnybrook Farm, starring Mary Pickford. The town was once home to
          Phoebe Apperson Hearst, who lived in a 50-room mansion on a
          2,000-acres estate that is now the site of Castlewood Country Club.
          The lively downtown has an Americana, small-town feel with historic
          buildings filled with great shops and restaurants offering al fresco
          dining. The Saturday morning farmers' market is one of the best in the
          East Bay.
